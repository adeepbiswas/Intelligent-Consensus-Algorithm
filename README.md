# Intelligent-Consensus-Algorithm
This repository contains the codebase for the project "Intelligent Consensus Algorithm". The project is an implementation of a consensus algorithm that uses intelligence (machine learning) to reach consensus in a distributed system.

# Main Components
The main components of the project are:

  1. Blockchain.py: This file contains the implementation of a blockchain, which is a key component of the consensus algorithm.
  2. ICA.py: This file contains the implementation of the Intelligent Consensus Algorithm.
  3. Nodes.py: This file contains the implementation of the nodes in the distributed system.
  4. createdataset.py: This file contains the code to create a dataset for training the machine learning model.
  5. createnodes.py: This file contains the code to create nodes in the distributed system.
  6. linearregression.py: This file contains the implementation of a linear regression model, which is used in the consensus algorithm.
  7. nativeNN.py: This file contains the implementation of a neural network, which is also used in the consensus algorithm.
  8. ploting.py: This file contains the code to plot the results of the consensus algorithm.

# Frameworks Used
The project is implemented in Python and uses several Python libraries, including:

  1. NumPy: For numerical computations.
  2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  3. Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
  4. Scikit-learn: For machine learning and data mining.

# How to Run the Code

python ICA.py  

# Additional Information
The project also includes a couple of shell scripts (cpu1.sh and cpu2.sh) that monitor the CPU usage of a process. These scripts can be useful for performance analysis.
The .idea directory contains configuration files for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. If you are using this IDE, you can import the project directly from these configuration files.
